# README

Podcast Vault is a way to find the download links and save the metadata for podcasts you love. This lets you download the files for long-term storage and enjoyment.

This is a Ruby on Rails app that allows anyone to add an XML feed to a podcast and the app will attempt to fetch all the details and parse the podcast episode details in an easy to read way.

## TODOs:

- Update concept within jobs, if changes happen then capture them.
- A subscription for created Podcasts (how often to check? Maybe Daily).
- Lock down extra episode routes.
- Support logins, think about storage charges aka billing.
